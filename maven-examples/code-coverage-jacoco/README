You can create code coverage reports by running the following commands on command line:

mvn clean test (Creates code coverage report for unit tests)
mvn clean verify -P integration-test (Creates code coverage report for integration tests)
mvn clean verify -P all-tests (Creates code coverage reports for unit and integration tests)
